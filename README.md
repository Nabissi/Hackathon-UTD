# Hackathon-UTD
Part of a challenge in october 2020 to create a game in unity within 5 days with a team of 4 people.
My team and I worked on this project throughout the week splitting the work among our team
My job was mainly to design levels and finding the assets we would use as well as helping one of my other teammates to
  create the actual code for interations, collisions, and other parts which was in c#
The zip file for the game is attached as it had too many files on its own 
Link to play the game within the browser: https://biowire20.itch.io/hopps
We had originally planned to create multiple levels for the game and I had designed a few other levels in space and another in fall scenery
  however we decided to limit it to one level as we didnt want to be spending too much time on it since this was going on during classes
